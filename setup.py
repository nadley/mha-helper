MHA helper is a Python module that supplements in doing proper failover using MHA_.
MHA is responsible for executing the important failover steps such as finding the
most recent slave to failover to, applying differential logs, monitoring master for
failure, etc. But it does not deal with additional steps that need to be taken
before and after failover. These would include steps such as setting the read-only
flag, killing connections, moving writer virtual IP, etc.

Required packages:
    PyMySQL
    paramiko

.. _MHA: https://code.google.com/p/mysql-master-ha/
